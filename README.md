# eportfolio-datascience_in_python
In my E-portfolio for my software engineering lecture i will give a small introduction into data science in python.
Especially i will show how to use Pandas to create Dataframes from a csv and to manipulate this Dataframes to extract useful information
## Preperation
### Data
- Get the prepared data (less work):
[combined_csv.csv](combined_csv.csv)
or
- Get the unprepard data (we will prepare it in the Live Coding):
[Spotify_Eportfolio_Data](Spotify_Eportfolio_Data)
### Program language and liabries
You need to have this program language and libraries installed
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
### Jupyter
You also should be able to run a Jupyter Notebook.
The fast and easy way is to use the [VSCode extention](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks)

## Live Coding
In the live Coding i will show you how to:
- get the used data from Spotify
  - This [script](Spotify_CSV_downloader.py)  is used here
- prepare the data so that we can use it properly
  - This [script](CSV_merger.py) is used here
- analyse the given data
  - This [file](pandas.ipynb) is used here
